Our service operates exclusively through the Tor network, ensuring accessibility via the Tor browser or a clearnet proxy. What's unique is that users don't have to sign up or log in at all. There are no sign-up processes whatsoever. Privacy and anonymity are at the core of our platform; users navigate without any discernible identity markers, eliminating the possibility of identifying one another. Colors and pseudonyms are non-existent within our interface, and all media shared undergoes meticulous metadata clearance for added anonymity and security.

Unlike traditional forums, we're more than just a message board. Each user can create their own channel that everyone else can see. What's unique is our decentralized moderation system: everyone in the community can moderate. That means anyone can delete a post, making everyone responsible for maintaining the forum's quality. Bans don't exist here; instead, we trust our users to curate the content they want to see.

Regarding moderation, when someone wants to delete a post, it triggers a "deletion war" channel where all flagged posts go. In this channel, a new button appears: "like" and "dislike". Each post has a 5-minute window where people can vote to keep or delete it, allowing users to engage in a sort of voting battle. When the 5 minutes are up, based on the votes, we either return the post to its original channel with a 10-minute cooldown for further deletion attempts or permanently delete it without leaving any traces.
