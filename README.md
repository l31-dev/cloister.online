Our service operates exclusively through the Tor network, ensuring accessibility via the Tor browser or a clearnet proxy. Privacy and anonymity are at the core of our platform; users navigate without any discernible identity markers, eliminating the possibility of identifying one another. Colors and pseudonyms are non-existent within our interface, and all media shared undergoes meticulous metadata clearance for added anonymity and security.

Distinguishing ourselves from the conventional forum model, we transcend the concept of a mere board. Each user possesses the ability to create their own channel, visible to all others. What sets us apart is the decentralized moderation system: every individual within the community holds the power to moderate. This means that anyone can delete any post, fostering a sense of collective responsibility for maintaining the platform's content quality. There are no bans on this platform; instead, we empower our users to curate the content they wish to engage with, placing trust in the community to shape and clean the forum according to their preferences.
